# DecentraRent2.0

🏠 DecentraRent

DecentraRent is a decentralized rental platform (DApp) that allows landlords and tenants to interact transparently via blockchain smart contracts. Built with a modern frontend and a Solidity-based smart contract backend, the project aims to disrupt the traditional rental system with secure, trustless agreements.
